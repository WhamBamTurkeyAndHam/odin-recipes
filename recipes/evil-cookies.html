        <h2>A WhamBam Special, The Worlds First: Milk and Tuna Mayo Cookies</h2>
        <p>Let's smash two cultral classics together. <em>What could go wrong?</em></p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <h3>Cookies:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup of white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup of packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of hot water</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>3 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups of semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Tuna Mayo Onigiri:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of uncooked sushi rice</li>
            <li>One can of Tuna</li>
            <li>Japanese Mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1½ cups of water</li>
            <li>Additional seperate water, about ¼ cup</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>2 sheets nori (dry seaweed), cut into 1/2-inch strips</li>
            <li>(Optional) 2 tablespoons of sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather your ingredients, making sure your butter is <strong>softened</strong>, and your eggs are <strong>room temperature</strong>.</li>
            <li>Mix your Tuna with the Mayonnaise in a small bowl, set aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Wash rice in a mesh strainer until water runs clear.<br>
                The <strong>easiest</strong> method is to use a rice cooker, simply the rice and water into the rice cooker and turn on.<br>
                Otherwise if you want to use a saucepan, combine washed rice and 1½ cups water in a saucepan.<br>
                Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low; cover, and simmer rice until water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.<br>
                Let rice rest for 15 minutes to continue to steam and become tender. Allow cooked rice to cool.</li>
            <li>Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth.</li>
            <li>Beat in eggs, one at a time, then stir in vanilla.</li>
            <li>Dissolve baking soda in hot water. Add to batter along with salt.</li>
            <li>Stir in both the flour and chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are nicely browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Contemplate what got you here? <em>Why</em> are you in the kitchen following this recipe?</strong></li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine ¼ cup water with salt in a small bowl; use to dampen hands before handling rice.<br>
                Divide cooked rice into equal portions. Should be about the size of your palm.</li>
            <li>Cool cookies on the baking sheets briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Crush half of the cookies up, mixing it with your tuna mayonnaise mixture.</li>
            <li>Create a dimple in the rice and fill with a heaping teaspoon of the tuna mayonnaise/cookie micture.<br>
                Cover with remaining portion of rice and press lightly to enclose filling inside rice ball.<br>
                Gently press rice to shape into a triangle.</li>
            <li>Jam a cookie into the side of the Onigiri as garnish, wrap with a strip of nori and optionally <em>(but not really)</em> sprinkle with sesame seeds and cookie crumbs. Repeat with remaining portions of rice.<br>
                Store in an airtight container or serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
