        <h2>Classic Japanese Dish: Onigiri with Tuna</h2>
        <p>One of the most simple recipes to come from Japan. It's <em>easy</em>, <em>light</em>, and most importantly, <em><strong>healthy</strong></em>.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of uncooked sushi rice</li>
            <li>One can of Tuna</li>
            <li>Japanese Mayonnaise, such as Kewpie</li>
            <li>1½ cups of water</li>
            <li>Additional seperate water, about ¼ cup</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>2 sheets nori (dry seaweed), cut into 1/2-inch strips</li>
            <li><em>(Optional)</em> 2 tablespoons sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash rice in a mesh strainer until water runs clear.<br>
                The <strong>easiest</strong> method is to use a rice cooker, simply put the rice and water into the rice cooker and turn on.<br>
                <em>Otherwise</em> if you want to use a saucepan, combine washed rice and 1½ cups water in a saucepan.<br>
                Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low; cover, and simmer rice until water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.<br>
                Let rice rest for 15 minutes to continue to steam and become tender. <strong>Allow cooked rice to cool.</strong></li>
            <li>Mix the can of Tuna with the Japanese Mayonnaise</li>
            <li>Combine ¼ cup water with salt in a small bowl; use to dampen hands before handling rice.<br>
                Divide cooked rice into equal portions. Should be about the size of your palm.</li>
            <li>Create a dimple in the rice and fill with a heaping teaspoon of the tuna mayonnaise.<br>
                Cover with rice and press lightly to enclose filling inside rice ball.<br>
                Gently press rice to shape into a triangle; wrap with a strip of nori and optionally sprinkle with sesame seeds. Repeat with remaining portions of rice.</li>
        </ol>
